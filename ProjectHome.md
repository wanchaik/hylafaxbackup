hylafaxBackup is a smart gui written in php to backup/restore all fax stored in any hylafax/avantfax server.
It could copy all data to external drive (like usb hard-disk or pen drive) or remotely on any ftp server.
So if your server will crash, fax images and mysql data are stored in a secure tar+gzip archive on an external device or in a remote ftp server.

hylafaxBackup also show some statistics and graph about the load of your server, like fax received for any days, month or year. It uses Google Chart Api.
